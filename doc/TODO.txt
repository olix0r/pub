  - Is 'auth' the name for this package?  Or 'cred'?   Or 'identity' or etc...

- Make realms seperate from Identities/Keys

- Differntiate the PubKeyService from the authorization mechanism.

- Provide a PrivKeyService (i.e. enhanced agent).

- Move 'jget' into a library.. and make it richer.
  And give it a name that doesn't sound like jdate.
