- Develope a clearer package model and naming convention.  Is 'auth' the name for
  this package?  Or 'cred'?   Or 'identity' or etc...

- Make realms seperate from Identities/Keys

- Seperate services from data objects, perhaps.

- Docstrings

- Ensure that the auth scheme is called PubKey.v1 and not something else...
